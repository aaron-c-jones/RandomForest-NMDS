# RandomForest-NMDS

The included script returns variable importance plots from the Random Forest algorithm and dissimilarity plots from the Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling algorithm. Data is not provided as this script was used for an environmental lab consulting project and thus the data is not mine to release.
